The dashboard provides real-time insights into exploits' performance during the current tick, reflects the state of the flags in the database, and displays the number of accepted flags for each exploit over the last ten ticks. 

Status icons portray the condition of each exploit, with a distinct "bug" icon signaling when an exploit impacts one of your own services, alerting the team to patch the service.

Two countdowns tell the time remaining until the next tick and the next flag submission, along with the progress bar on top that represents the progression of the current tick.
