# ðŸš© Fast - Flag Acquisition and Submission Tool

Fast is a Python tool designed to easily manage your exploits and submit flags in A/D competitions.

## Installation

To install Fast, follow these steps:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dusanlazic/fast.git
cd fast
pip install .
```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the directory containing your exploit scripts. Directory structure may look like this, and exploits should follow this [simple guideline](#exploit-script-guidelines).

```
myexploits/
â”œâ”€â”€ alpha.py
â”œâ”€â”€ bravo.py
â”œâ”€â”€ charlie.py
â”œâ”€â”€ delta.py
â””â”€â”€ echo.py
```


1. In the same directory, create a file called `exploits.txt`. This file will contain the names of your exploits and their target IPs. Each line should begin with the name of an exploit (with or without .py), followed by the IPs of its targets. IP ranges can be expressed using hyphens. For example:

```
alpha 172.20.0.2-7
bravo 172.20.0.2 172.20.0.5-7
charlie 172.20.0.3
delta 172.20.0.2 172.20.0.5-7
echo 172.20.0.2-7
```

3. Run fast

```sh
fast
```

## Exploit Script Guideline

Your exploit scripts should follow certain guidelines to work properly with Fast:

1. Each script should have a function named `exploit`.

2. The `exploit` function should take one parameter, `target`, which is the target's IP address.

3. The `exploit` function should return the flag as a string.

Here is a very basic example of how an exploit script should be structured:

```python
import requests

def exploit(target):
    return requests.get(f"http://{target}:8000/flag").text
